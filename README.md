# Problem 3
(solved with the code 'problema3.csv' )
There is a client that has collected among its many brands, information for several years about the revenue it collects each week and the investment done on TV and digital.\\

The data may be found in the file media$\_$optimisation.csv.\\

The client has now the budget for the next three weeks: $B_1 = 200$, $B_2 = 800$, and $B_3 = 1600$. For each of these cases, device a model that allows us to decide what proportion of the budget to invest on TV and how much to invest in digital as to optimise the revenue each week.\\
